Installation
============

SIP can be downloaded and installed from
`PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sip/>`_::

    pip3 install sip

This will install the :program:`sip5` code generator and the :mod:`sip` module
for Python v3.  Using a version of :program:`pip` for Python v2.7 will install
the :mod:`sip` module only.

SIP can also be downloaded from the
`Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`__ repository at
http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/hg/sip.

SIP is also included with all of the major Linux distributions.  However, it
may be a version or two out of date.
